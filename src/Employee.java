 * Course 605.201.81 Summer 2020
 * Assignment 6 Question 1
 * 
 * Project Specs:
 * Write a program that models an employee. It should have an employee number, a name, an address, 
 * and a hire date. To keep things simple, your classes donâ€™t need to do any editing of data. You may
 * use the Date class from the lectures or define your own. The Java-supplied Date class cannot be used.   
 * 
 * name: first name and a last name. 
 * address: street, a city, a state (2 characters), and a 5-digit zipcode. 
 * date: an integer month, day and year. The Date fields should be reasonably valid values 
 * 		(ex. month 1-12, day 1-31, year > 1900 and < 2020). 
 * 
 * Project Deliverables:
 * 
 * 1. Create an Employee, a first/last name, an address, and a date classes in your solution.
 * 
 * 2. Provide appropriate class constructors, getter methods, setter methods, toString() and any 
 *    other methods you think are necessary. 
 *    
 * 3. The classes should not do any direct user input/output. All user input/output will be done in 
 *    the main method.
 *    
 * 4. Your program should prompt the user to enter data for several employees, store the data in an array
 *    of type Employee, and then display the data.
